I held a talk at the Bergen Open Source Conference about Bluesky and ATProto.
The talk went into some of the central ideas and concepts in Bluesky and ATProto, and how they might solve the scaling and data portability issues that plague the current social media landscape.
ATProto is a federated social media protocol that aims to provide a base platform on top of which people can build their own decentralized social media platforms.
Bluesky is a microblogging platform that aims to be the first platform to implement ATProto.
