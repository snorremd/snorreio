I held a talk at a Supabase meetup about my time tracking app, [Ajanottaja](https://ajanottaja.app).
The talk went through my process from building a classical database, api, and frontend app to migrating to using Supabase.
I presented some of the challenges faced when building an API on top of a classical database, and how Supabase can help solve some of these issues.
Some of the topics I covered included tables and views as automatic REST endpoints, stored procedures as API functions, and finally row level security as a way to secure your data.
The talk was mostly high level and served to give the audience a feel for how easy it is to get started with Supabase.

Attending the meetup was a great experience, and I encourage you to keep an eye out for more [Supabase meetups in Bergen](https://lu.ma/user/kriryk).
