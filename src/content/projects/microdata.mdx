Worked on a national platform in Norway for conducting research based on SSB's register data with a team from NSD (now Sikt) and SSB (Norway's statistical agency).
The project implements a new web based statistical analysis platform that grants researchers access to SSB's register data from the browser without exposing raw data.

I helped set up the initial continuous deployment tooling to build the services and deploy them.
Further more I developed the initial public site and variabel overview site with metadata about the variables available on the platform.
Some contributions were made on the backend systems and on the analysis frontend itself.
