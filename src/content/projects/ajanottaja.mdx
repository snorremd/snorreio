An open source time keeping app to keep track of my work hours.
Initially implemented as a Clojure JSON over HTTP API and a SPA React frontend.
Later ported to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
Uses Postgres database as a datastore.
The project was started so I could keep track of my work time, but also to hone my skills with Clojure code and to keep up with the React and JavaScript ecosystem.
