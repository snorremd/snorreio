Code Monkey Clash is an open source code competition workshop game I've been working on.
It is heavily inspired by the [Extreme Startup](https://github.com/rchatley/extreme_startup) game I once played.
This project is mostly done for fun and to learn new things.
It was implemented using technologies and solutions like:
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - A JavaScript runtime, bundler, and test runner
- [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com) - A Bun framework for building web applications
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org) - A JavaScript library library that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) - A Tailwind CSS component library
