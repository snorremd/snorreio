Snorre.io is my personal website where I share thoughts, musical recordings, beer recipes, and more.
You are in fact reading this text on my website right now!
It has undergone several iterations and is currently built with [Astro](https://astro.build).
I value privacy and have built the website with this in mind.
It runs on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and uses some Cloudflare features.
This includes D1 database for persisting some dynamic user interactions and R2 storage for distributing music files.

My personal website serves as a playground for testing neat ideas and technologies.
I get to use technology I'd otherwise not have a chance to use in my day job.
This includes Solidjs, a React-like library focused on signals that compiles to native DOM operations.

My hope is that my website can be a source of inspiration for others.
The website is [open source](https://github.com/snorremd/snorreio).
Feel free to take a look at the code and use it as a starting point for your own website.
