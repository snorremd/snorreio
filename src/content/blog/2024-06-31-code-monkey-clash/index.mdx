title: "Code Monkey Clash - A Code Competition Workshop Game"
---

Code Monkey Clash is an open source code competition workshop game I've been working on.
Many years ago I played the [Extreme Startup](https://github.com/rchatley/extreme_startup) workshop game.
I also hosted an Extreme Startup workshop once during my time at university.
Later a colleague hosted a session at work, and I started thinking it would be fun to renew the experience.
Code Monkey Clash is my take on the concept with new questions and a whole new implementation!

## The concept and gameplay

The game is a workshop where participants are challenged to solve questions by writing code.
Each player creates an HTTP server that accepts a `GET` request with a question, and responds with the answer.
The game master runs a server that sends questions to the players and evaluates the answers.
Based on the answer, or the lack thereof, the game server assigns points to the players, and adjusts the question interval.
