title: "Code Monkey Clash - A Code Competition Workshop Game"
---

Code Monkey Clash is an open source code competition workshop game I've been working on.
Many years ago I played the [Extreme Startup](https://github.com/rchatley/extreme_startup) workshop game.
I also hosted an Extreme Startup workshop once during my time at university.
Later a colleague hosted a session at work, and I started thinking it would be fun to renew the experience.
Code Monkey Clash is my take on the concept with new questions and a whole new implementation!
