[Snorre.io](http://snorre.io) is the new homepage of Snorre Magnus Davøen, me. As you can see it is not quite a homepage yet. Snorre.io will currently serve as a blog where I can post my experiences, my thoughts on various subjects, tutorials on different technologies, and posts presenting my work.

Snorre.io runs on the Ghost blogging platform. Ghost is currently not very feature rich. As new features are introduced and the Ghost API is stabilized I might add new features to my homepage.

So long.
