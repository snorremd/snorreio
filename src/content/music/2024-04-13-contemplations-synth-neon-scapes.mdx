I bought a [Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 Gen 4](https://focusrite.com/products/scarlett-4i4) as a christmas present to myself last year.
I've always enjoyed improvising music on my synthesizers, but I never really had the gear to record something properly.
The situation changed with the Scarlett and I've now started to practice recording my synths with GarageBand on my Mac.

This is the first track I've recorded in what I hope will become a series of recordings for you to enjoy.
I do not predict a regular schedule or high musical talent for these recordings, but I hope you'll enjoy them anyway.
If you find them interesting or enjoyable, please let me know and I'll be more motivated to continue recording and sharing them.

## The track

I hope you enjoy this first track, "Contemplations on synth: Neon Scapes".
It was recorded in a few hours on this rainy Saturday afternoon.
I was inspired by some of the old 80s synth music.
The track has a monotonous bass arpeggio to set the rythm.
A mellow pad sound sets the somewhat melancholic mood.
The synth lead stands out and culminates in a dissonant tone to emphasise the somewhat dystopian feel of the track.

## Distributing my music

For now I'll be sharing my music on two platforms: Soundcloud and my own website.
Soundcloud gives me a good platform to get a bit of reach and allows people to provide feedback.
It is however not privacy friendly and I want to make sure that my music is available to everyone!
That's why I'll also be sharing my music on my own website as well.

Currently I'm using the standard HTML5 audio player to allow playback of the music straight from my website.
There are also download links to the music files in various formats if you want to listen to them in a player of your choice.
The web audio player will select the best format for your device if you choose to play the music directly from my website.

In the future I might build a Soundcloud like player for my website using [Wavesurfer][https://wavesurfer.xyz/].
This is a bigger task and I'll have to see if I can find the time to do it.
For now I hope you enjoy the music as it is provided.
