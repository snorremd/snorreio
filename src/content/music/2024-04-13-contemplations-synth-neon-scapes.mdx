I hope you enjoy this first track, "Contemplations on synth: Neon Scapes".
It was recorded in a few hours on this rainy Saturday afternoon.
I was inspired by some of the old 80s synth music.
The track has a monotonous bass arpeggio to set the rythm.
A mellow pad sound sets the somewhat melancholic mood.
The synth lead stands out and culminates in a dissonant tone to emphasise the somewhat dystopian feel of the track.
