Netflix recently released the second season of [Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_Kimmy_Schmidt), one of their original series focused around situational comedy. The first season introduced the titular character Kimmy Schmidt and bootstrapped the series with a rather bizarre premise:

> The series follows 29-year-old Kimmy Schmidt (Kemper) as she adjusts to life in New York City after her rescue from a doomsday cult in Indiana where she and three other women were held by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm) for 15 years. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_Kimmy_Schmidt)

Now the series is back for yet another humorous season. It picks right up where season one left and Kimmy is as goofy as ever. Where many American sitcoms rely on laugh tracks and predictive social situations to entertain, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt will throw out ludicrous plot lines and make you laugh without using as much as an ounce of canned laugh track. The lack of laugh track makes the series' pacing better and allows the series to have more serious moments.

On the face of it some might reject Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on the grounds of being a "girly" show, but they would be missing out on what is a great sitcom. I also commend the show's creators for writing a comedy with strong female leads as shows in the comedy genre seems to usually center around male characters.
