In this post you will learn about how I built a comment interface on top the [ATProto](https://atproto.com/) protocol and [Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz) social network.
The post is relatively technical, but I also try to tell a story of how I got to this point.
Read on if you are interested in social networks, decentralized protocols, open standards, and Bluesky.


## Some history first

This is not the first time I've tried to run a comment system on my blog.
I was determined to create a nice blog, and any nice blog needs a comment system right?
[Disqus](https://disqus.com/) was out of the question for reasons of privacy and tracking.

Research suggested that [Isso](https://isso-comments.de/) was a good option.
Isso [solved a lot of the problems](/blog/2016-05-03-isso-a-lightweight-privacy-minded-comment-system) I had with Disqus.
It was self hosted, stored everything in a SQLite database, and was open source.
Additionally it did not require users to sign up for an account in order to comment.
Isso is probably still a good option for many people, but alas I eventually wanted something with more features.

Along came [Coral Talk](https://coralproject.net/).
It was open source, backed by Mozilla (at the time), and had a lot of features.
The implementation supported plugins and was written in Node.js, meaning I could read the source code.
I even built a more privacy friendly [Gravatar plugin](/blog/2018-04-25-a-privacy-respecting-talk-gravatar-plugin/).
Unlike Isso though it was rather heavy, complex to setup, and required a database.
It slowly dawned on me that I was not a news site and probably not in need of all the features Coral Talk provided.

## The Fediverse and the micro community trap

Meanwhile a lot of interesting things where happening in the social network space.
People were exploring and building decentralized or federated social network protocols.
One of the more successful attempts at the time were [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is perhaps the most recognizable project using ActivityPub.
As the experience of Twitter became ever more toxic Mastodon seemed like a promising alternative.
One of the things that these new social networks promised was data ownership and portability.

An idea started to form in my head, what if I use Mastodon as a comment system?
Then people could comment on my posts on Mastodon and I could fetch the comments and display them on my blog.
I joined one of the "official" Mastodon instances in the hope that a lot of people would be there.
But with time it became clear that the fediverse was pretty small and fragmented.
It would be difficult to get the reach I wanted for my blog as the right people would have to share my posts for it to reach multiple instances.
The protocol is also quite complex and implementing a client capable of adding comments to the fediverse seemed a bit daunting.

## Cryptobros and web3 enthusiasts

Later Elon Musk bought Twitter and again I wanted to find a new home for my social media presence.
Someone posted about [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) and after reading about the protocol I decided to give it a try.
Nostr is a true decentralized social network protocol, and as such does not present the same issues as Mastodon in terms of fragmentation.
Running a server seemed simpler, and content would be more discoverable across servers.
But to my big dismay the network seemed full of cryptobros, web3 enthusiasts, and other people I did not desire to engage with.
Back when I was in university, Web 3.0, the future of the web, was all about the semantic web and linked data.
Not at all about crypto currencies, smart contracts and pyramid schemes.
But I digress.


## ATProto and Bluesky

I was about to give up on the idea of having a comment system when I came across the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) and [Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz).
ATProto saw its infancy inside Twitter, but was later spun out as an independent project and company.
Like Mastodon the protocol is federated, but not focused on keeping instances separate.
Instead ATProto is based on global discovery services and freedom to choose your algorithms.
No matter what instance you are on you can see content from other instances, perfect!

So after receiving an invite to the Bluesky server I started looking at the protocol and client libraries.
I won't go into too much details about the protocol here, but I will try to summarise the important bits.

Every user has a *repository* of data records, each record being some unspecified type of data.
Each ATProto data server also has a lexicon of *record types* that enumerate the types .
For Bluesky data types could be things like post, like, follow, profile, etc.
Additionnaly the lexicon describes *methods*, i.e. things you can do on the server.
For Bluesky these include fetching a post thread or creating a new post.

For my comment system I essentially only needed three methods from the Bluesky server:

- `app.bsky.feed.getPostThread` to fetch all the replies to a post I use as a comment thread
- `app.bsky.feed.post` to add a new comment to a blog post or reply to an existing comment
- `app.bsky.feed.like` to allow users to like a comment

## Implementation

I had a few goals for the implementation of my Bluesky-based comment system:

- Keep it reasonsbly light weight
- Fit seamlessly into my blog design
- Simple enough implementation
- Don't gather any data unless necessary

My choice fell on a client-side only solution using the [Astro islands pattern](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
The islands pattern allows you to integrate client-side components at specific points in your static site.
Astro also supports [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), a relatively young client-side library for building user interfaces.
Conceptually it is similar to React, but escews the virtual DOM and instead compiles to native DOM operations.
It also has a very small run time footprint, but still manages to be fast and provide the features I need.

I would also need to talk to the Bluesky server somehow.
While I could have implemented the lexicon methods from scratch we are fortunate enough that there is an [ATProto client](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/api).
The ATProto client libraries are written in TypeScript and are quite easy to use in a typical Type/JavaScript project.
It provides a simple API for talking to the server and also handles authentication.

You can find the source code for the comment system [here](https://github.com/snorremd/snorreio/blob/main/src/components/comments).

### Authentication

Users authenticate using their Bluesky handle and app password.
To keep the authentication live I cache the authentication token in local storage so that it can be reused on page reloads.
The token is also used to fetch the user's profile information, which is used to display the user's avatar and name.

### Fetching and displaying comments

The first thing I do when the comment component is mounted and a user is logged in is to fetch the comments for the current post.
I do this by calling the `app.bsky.feed.getPostThread`.
The reponse is a tree shaped structure of posts, with an optional `parent` and a list of one or more `replies`.
The `parent` is the post that the current post is a reply to, and the `replies` are the posts that are replies to the current post.

I initially thought that the simplest way to display the comments would be to use a recursive component.
This would make the rendering code a bit more complex, but it would allow me to render without having to do data transformations.
With this approach I would display the thread using the old school nested comments view where each reply is indented.
But how would this handle very long reply chains?
And would users familiar with the modern flat comments view be confused by the nested view?

I decided to go with a flat view mimicing the Bluesky app, but I was stumped on how they flattened the tree!
Fortunately Bluesky is open source, so I could just go and look at the source code.
It turns out that two functions are essential in determining the view.
The [`PostThreadItemModel.assignTreeModels`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/blob/257c15ec1f1b327e21f6e1f5707e6c0724d3afc6/src/state/models/content/post-thread-item.ts#L74)
method determines for each post if reply lines should be shown.
The [`flattenThread`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/blob/257c15ec1f1b327e21f6e1f5707e6c0724d3afc6/src/view/com/post-thread/PostThread.tsx#L329C11-L329C24)
function then flattens the tree into a list of posts, first walking up any parent posts and then walking down the replies.
There is also a sorting step, but I decided to skip that as I don't expect to have a lot of comments.

#### Should we show reply lines?

I simplified the `assignTreeModels` method, but the basic idea is the same.
When you fetch a post thread you can specify a `highlightedPost` which is the post that the user is currently viewing.
This puts the outermost post in the response in the middle of the tree!
After checking the first parent we recursively check the parent's parent until we reach the original post.

Next we start enumerating all the replies and for each reply check if we should add reply lines.
Reply lines are added if the reply has replies of its own.

```ts
function addThreadUIData(
  threadViewPost: ThreadViewPostUI,
  walkChildren = true,
  walkParent = true,
): ThreadViewPostUI {
  let parent = threadViewPost.parent;
  if (walkParent && AppBskyFeedDefs.isFeedViewPost(threadViewPost.parent)) {
    // Recursively add UI data to parent
    const newParent = {
      ...threadViewPost.parent,
      showParentReplyLine: false,
      showChildReplyLine: false,
      isHighlightedPost: false,
    } satisfies ThreadViewPostUI;
    threadViewPost.parent = newParent;
    addThreadUIData(newParent, (walkChildren = false), (walkParent = true));
  }

  let replies: ThreadViewPostUI[] = []
  if (walkChildren && threadViewPost.replies?.length) {
    replies = threadViewPost.replies
      .map((reply) => {
        if (AppBskyFeedDefs.isThreadViewPost(reply)) {
          // Recursively add UI data to children
          return addThreadUIData({
            ...reply,
            showParentReplyLine: threadViewPost?.isHighlightedPost ? false : true,
            showChildReplyLine: (reply?.replies?.length ?? 0) > 0 ? true : false,
            isHighlightedPost: false,
          } satisfies ThreadViewPostUI);
        }
        return undefined;
      })
      .filter((x): x is ThreadViewPostUI => x !== undefined);
  }

  return { ...threadViewPost, parent, replies };
}
```

#### Flattening the tree

Here the Bluesky app code used a fairly smart trick.
JavaScript has a concept called [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator).
Generators allow you to write functions that can be paused and resumed.
The Bluesky app ingeniously uses this to flatten the tree.
The `flattenThread` function is a generator that yields posts as it walks up the tree and then down the replies.
By using a recursive generator function we can produce a flat list without producing a lot of intermediate data structures.

My `flatten` function is more or less the same as theirs.
It first recursively walks up the tree, yielding the result of calling `flatten` on the parent.
Once we reach the top of the tree we yield the post being flattened.
This ensures the root parent is yielded first, then the second parent, and so forth.
Note that the tree does not contain the siblings of the parents as this data is not interesting in context of the highlighted post.

The `flatten` function then yields the highlighted post as it has now yielded all parents.

Finally we walk down the replies yielding the result of recursively calling `flatten` on each reply.
This causes the recursive calls to be evaluated in a [pre order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal) of the tree.
It begins with the left most child, then the left most child of the left most child, and so forth.

```ts
export function* flatten(
  thread: ThreadViewPostUI,
): Generator<ThreadViewPostUI, void> {
  if (thread.parent) {
    if (isKnownType(thread.parent)) {
      if (AppBskyFeedDefs.isThreadViewPost(thread.parent)) {
        yield* flatten(thread.parent as ThreadViewPostUI);
      }
    }
  }

  yield thread;

  if (thread.replies && thread.replies.length > 0) {
    for (const reply of thread.replies) {
      if (isKnownType(reply)) {
        if (AppBskyFeedDefs.isThreadViewPost(reply)) {
          yield* flatten(reply as ThreadViewPostUI);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you think about the order in which the posts are yielded you will recognise the Bluesky app view.
It shows a chain of posts down to the highlihted post without any of the sibling replies.
From the highligted post it shows the replies in a flat list, showing nested replies as a chain.
This is exactly what we want!




### Styling and layout

I wanted the comment system to fit seamlessly into my blog design.
So I just used the same styling setup as the rest of my blog.
It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to style content.
Tailwidn has seen its fair share of criticism, but I find it to be a very pleasent and flexible way to style content.

Essentially Tailwind is a set of CSS utility classes that represent common CSS properties.
What makes Tailwind so special is that the utility classes are built on top of a design system.
Unlike using regular CSS, where you have to decide on the values for each property, Tailwind provides a set of values that work well together.

Tailwind defines a list of colors, whitespace sizes, font sizes, border radii, etc.
You can then use these values to get consistent styling across your site.
For example, instead of deciding on a specific font size for a heading you can use the `text-2xl` class.
If you always use the `text-2xl` class for h1 headings you can easily change the font size for all headings by changing the value of `text-2xl`.

You could of course define a design system using CSS Custom Properties (aka CSS variables).
But then you'd have to write css classes for each type of layout and component in your markup.
Tailwind frees you from having to artifically separate style from markup and grouping css attributes into classes.
Instead you can just use the utility classes directly in your markup.

With Tailwind you'd write something like this:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4">
  <h1 class="text-2xl">Hello world</h1>
  <p class="text-lg">This is a paragraph</p>
</div>
```

Instead of this:

```html
<div class="my-component">
  <h1 class="my-component__heading">Hello world</h1>
  <p class="my-component__paragraph">This is a paragraph</p>
</div>
```

```css
.my-component {
  background-color: var(--color-gray-100);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  padding: var(--spacing-4);
}

.my-component__heading {
  font-size: var(--font-size-2xl);
}

.my-component__paragraph {
  font-size: var(--font-size-lg);
}
```

### Privacy and data collection

I wanted to avoid collecting any data about my users.
The comment system is entirely handled client-side, so I don't have to worry about storing any data.
When users comment on my blog all communication goes directly to the Bluesky server.
Users can easily check that no data is sent to my server by inspecting the network requests.
I never touch any data and never see my readers' passwords.
All in all I consider this a big win.
Of course my readers now need to trust a third party, but if you are on Bluesky you already trust them.

## Conclusion

I am very happy with the result.
The comment system is light weight, easy to use, and fits seamlessly into my blog design.
This is a one time integration, so I don't have to worry about maintaining a server or database.
I also don't have to worry about privacy as I don't collect any data.
The only downside is that users need to have a Bluesky account, but as it becomes more available I hope this will be less of an issue.

The comment system is currently in a minimal viable product state.
It works and looks pretty good, but there are missing features and imperfections.
Among other things I would like to support clicking a reply to highlight it, just like the Bluesky app.
It would also be nice to extract it into a separate component that can be reused on other sites.
But for now I am happy with the result and I hope you will enjoy using it.
