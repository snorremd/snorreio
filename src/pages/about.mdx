I hail from Bergen, Norway a small city on the west coast of Norway.
Between 2008 and 2014 I studies various subjects at the University of Bergen.
Eventually I graduated with a masters degree in information science.
From 2014 to 2020 I worked as a developer at the [Norwegian centre for research data](https://nsd.no).
I learnt a lot among other things the beauty of functional programming with Clojure.
Later I joined [Adventure Tech](https://adventuretech.no) where I build solutions for the travel industry.

In my free time I enjoy playing video games, playing synths, and working on side projects.
This is one of them.
I have been looking at [Astro](https://astro.build), a new static site generator, for a while now.
This web site is my first attempt at using it.
Other projects include [Ajanottaja](https://ajanottaja.app) a time tracking app for my own work needs.

Like many other developers I also brew beer.
I have been brewing for about 10 years now.
Nothing beats a good belgian trappist style beer.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/snorremd), [GitHub](https://github.com/snorremd) and other places.
